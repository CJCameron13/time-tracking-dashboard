## My process

This project was built across a few different platforms over a longer than usual period of time than I typically spend on projects. Overall it was not as well planned as I would have liked but nonetheless I was able to get it done. I prefer a desktop-first workflow. To this point it still makes it easier for me to visualize and plan how my elements need to flow and interact with one another. Beyond that, my process was fairly straightforward. I initially intended to use the JSON file provided, however after coding the numbers directly into the HTML file and using Javascript to allow the user to determine what data should appear, I realized now did not need the JSON data. I would like to become familiar with incorporating JSON data in the future.

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Since I ended up forgoing the use of the JSON file, I was familiar with all parts of the completion of this project. It was nice to have a refresher on CSS grid as I had not used that feature in awhile.

### Continued development

My biggest takeaway is that I need to become a more thorough planner for my projects. I started the project, took a significant amount of time away from it, and upon returning to it never felt like I had a real sense of direction. I was able to tackle it and figure out problems on the fly, but I felt aloof to how the entirety of my code fit together as a whole. In the future I'd like to put together a more concrete plan the accounts for each part of the process as much as possible.
